# Mouse Race

Mouse Race is an interactive React-based game where players click to collect and change elements on the screen. 
The game starts with a central 'Start' button, randomizing element positions. A timer tracks elapsed time, and players win by making all Collect and Change elements disappear through strategic clicks. 
Player scores are stored on Firebase, and a scoreboard displaying the top 3 players is updated in real-time.
